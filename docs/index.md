I'm currently a PhD candidate in Applied Physics at Caltech (supervised by Professor Marco Bernardi). 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at UC Berkeley in 2021. 

# Research Interests 

My main research focus has been on electron-phonon interactions in correlated materials. 
* I developed methods for electron-phonon scattering and transport in the content of correlated electronic states and applied them to Sr~2~RuO~4~
* I investigated the respective roles of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the transport and quasiparticle properties of SrVO~3~
* I developed finite difference methods to study the effects of correlation on electron-phonon coupling within DFT+DMFT.

I've also done some work using tight-binding based methods to extend studies of electron-lattice interactions to materials where system size or anharmonicity prevent the use of first-principles methods.
